Welcome to the **Coffee Shop App UI** repository! This project showcases the user interface design for a coffee shop mobile app created using **Figma**. The app is designed to provide coffee lovers with a seamless and intuitive experience for browsing the menu, placing orders, and managing their coffee preferences.

This is a **UI-only** project, which focuses solely on the design and layout of the app interface. It is not a functional app, but rather a **Figma mockup** that showcases the user journey and app design.
